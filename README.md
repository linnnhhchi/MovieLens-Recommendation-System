The project will be devoted to configuring, evaluating and comparing recommender system models. It consists of two parts: (1) preparing and understanding the provided dataset and (2) describing, configuring, and comparing the selected algorithms against a given baseline.

The dataset to be used in this project concerns the MovieLens1 dataset created by GroupLens Research, which is a humanâ€“computer interaction research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Min- nesota. The dataset contains 27,753,444 five-star ratings across 58,098 movies and 283,228 users. The data was collected between January 09, 1995 and September 26, 2018. The dataset was generated on September 26, 2018. Users were selected at random for inclusion. It is important to notice that all selected users had rated at least one movie. Each user is represented by an ID. No other information (such as demographic information) was collected.
